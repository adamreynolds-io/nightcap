# NIGHTCAP

Nightcap is [Midnight Foundation](https://github.com/midnightntwrk)'s *proposed* Midnight development environment for professionals. Designed to simplify building, testing, and deploying smart contracts and dApps on the Midnight blockchain. Inspired by Ethereum's [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) (and many others), Nightcap aims to provide a flexible environment for Midnight developers with features tailored to the unique aspects of the Midnight network.

## PROPOSED FEATURES
Nightcap is a work in progress, but here are some of the proposed features:

- **Local Midnight node simulation** for rapid development and testing of Compact Contracts.
- **Automated contract compilation, deployment, and verification** workflows.
- **Plugin architecture** to extend functionality for Midnight-specific use cases and support custom plugins.
- **Scriptable tasks** for common developer operations, including scaffolding TypeScript dApps.
- **Integration with Midnight's security and compliance tooling.**

## BE PART OF THE JOURNEY

Nightcap is an open source project maintained by the [Midnight Foundation](https://midnightfoundation.io/). We welcome contributions from the community to help improve and expand its capabilities.
